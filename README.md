The Research Management Tool system is a new self-contained software product developed by the project team to address problems with the current manual system. The newly introduced system will provide easy access, user-friendly functions, and attractive interfaces. It offers better options for handling large-scale physical research files, resolving calculation errors, and addressing all other specified tasks. The final outcome of this project will significantly increase the efficiency of almost all tasks performed within the research management tool system in a much more convenient manner.
